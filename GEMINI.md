# Ewerton Workout App: Project Context for AI Assistant

### Project Overview

The primary goal of this project was to create a functional workout tracking application named the "Ewerton Workout App". The user, Ewerton, is a developer who prefers short, concise responses and is proficient in JavaScript and TypeScript.

### Technology Stack

- **Framework:** Vue.js

- **Language:** TypeScript

- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, with support for Sass (SCSS)

- **Tooling:** Vite, ESLint, Prettier, Husk

### Key Features and Development History

1. **Core Application:** The initial application was built to track workout days, allowing the user to log sets, reps, and weight. The app supports two pre-defined workout days and includes a "Reset Day" function. User progress is persisted using the browser's `localStorage`.

2. **Theming:** A feature was added to support both a light and a dark theme. The theme is toggled via a button and the user's preference is saved in `localStorage`.

3. **Styling:** The styling was initially done with Tailwind CSS. Upon request, the project was updated to support Sass (SCSS) for future styling flexibility.

4. **Documentation and Delivery:**
   - The user requested a "zip file" of the project and assistance with adding it to their GitHub repository. I provided a full set of files and step-by-step instructions for local setup and Git commands to push the project to GitHub.

   - A `FEATURES.md` file was created and later updated to serve as a comprehensive summary of the project's features and development history.

   - Extra requirement and features will be saved on folder `Features`. And each Feature file will have it's feature name and a version/tracking number.
