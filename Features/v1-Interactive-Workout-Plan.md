# Feature Request: Interactive Workout Plan

**Objective:** Convert the static `interactive-workout-plan.html` into a fully functional and interactive Vue.js application.

**Details:**

- **Base:** The new implementation will be based on the layout, styling, and functionality defined in the `interactive-workout-plan.html` file.
- **State Management:** The workout data and user progress will be managed in a dedicated `useWorkoutStore.ts` composable.
- **Component Structure:** The application will be broken down into reusable Vue components:
  - `app.vue` (Main container and tabs)
  - `WorkoutDay.vue` (Displays exercises for a specific day)
  - `ProgressTracker.vue` (Shows completion progress)
- **Styling:** Styles will be extracted from the HTML and placed in `assets/styles/main.scss`.
