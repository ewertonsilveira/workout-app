This feature addresses and resolves the `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined` error encountered on the "Browse Workouts" page when `ExerciseItem.vue` was used.

### Plan & Execution

1.  **Diagnose the Error:** The error occurred because `ExerciseItem.vue` was attempting to access properties like `store.exercises[day][category][exerciseIndex].completed` even when `day`, `category`, or `exerciseIndex` were `undefined` (which happens when `ExerciseItem` is used in the "Browse Workouts" context, where it receives `NewExercise` objects that don't have these tracking-related properties).
2.  **Refactor `ExerciseItem.vue`:**
    *   **Conditional Rendering:** The `v-if="isTrackingMode"` directive was already in place to conditionally render the tracking-related UI elements (checkbox and `NumberStepper` components).
    *   **Safe Data Access with Computed Property:** A new computed property, `currentExerciseData`, was introduced.
        *   This computed property safely accesses `store.exercises[props.day][props.category][props.exerciseIndex]` only when `isTrackingMode` is true and all necessary `props.day`, `props.category`, and `props.exerciseIndex` are defined.
        *   When `isTrackingMode` is false (i.e., in the "Browse Workouts" context), `currentExerciseData` simply returns `props.exercise` (which is a `NewExercise` object).
    *   **Binding Update:** The `v-model` and `@update:modelValue` bindings for the checkbox and `NumberStepper` components were updated to use `currentExerciseData.completed`, `currentExerciseData.sets`, `currentExerciseData.reps`, and `currentExerciseData.weight` respectively.
    *   **Console Logs Removed:** The debugging `console.log` statements were removed.

This solution ensures that `ExerciseItem.vue` can be safely used in both workout tracking mode (where it receives full `Exercise` objects with tracking data) and browse mode (where it receives `NewExercise` objects without tracking data), preventing runtime errors.
