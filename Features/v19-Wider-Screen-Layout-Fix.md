# Feature: Wider Screen Layout Fix

## Version: 19

### User Story

As a user, on wider screens, I want the "Workout Day" and "Session Summary" sections to be closer together for a more compact and readable layout.

### Plan & Execution

1.  **Identify Layout Issue:**
    -   Inspected `src/views/RecordWorkout.vue` and identified that the `grid` layout combined with `max-w-6xl mx-auto` was causing a large gap between the main content and the summary sidebar on wider screens.

2.  **Refactor Layout to Flexbox:**
    -   Replaced the `grid` layout with a `flexbox` layout.
    -   Wrapped the two main sections in a `div` with `flex flex-col lg:flex-row gap-8`.
    -   Assigned widths to the columns using `lg:w-2/3` for the main content and `lg:w-1/3` for the summary.
    -   Wrapped the entire component in a `div` with `max-w-7xl mx-auto` to constrain the maximum width and maintain a pleasant line length on very wide screens.
    -   This change makes the layout more responsive and eliminates the excessive gap.
