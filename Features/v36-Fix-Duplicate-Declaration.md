This feature addresses and resolves the 'defaultExercises' redeclaration error in `src/composables/useWorkoutStore.ts`.

### Plan & Execution

1.  **Identify Duplicate Declaration:** Located the duplicate `const defaultExercises: WorkoutData = { ... }` block and the redundant `import { reactive, watch, computed } from 'vue';` statement.
2.  **Remove Duplicate Code:** Deleted the second occurrence of `defaultExercises` and the extra import statement.

This ensures the `useWorkoutStore.ts` file is correctly parsed and compiled, resolving the internal server error.
