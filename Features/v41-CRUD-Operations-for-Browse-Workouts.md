# Feature: CRUD Operations for Browse Workouts

## Plan

1.  **Create Feature File**: I will create a new feature file `v41-CRUD-Operations-for-Browse-Workouts.md` in the `features` folder to document the new functionalities.
2.  **Analyze Existing Code**: I will start by reviewing the `src/views/BrowseWorkoutsView.vue` file to understand the current implementation of the workout list and how the data is being handled.
3.  **Implement CRUD Operations**:
    *   **Create**: I will add a button that will open a modal or a new view, allowing users to create a new workout. The form will include fields for workout name, description, and exercises.
    *   **Read**: I will ensure the existing list of workouts is maintained and updated in real-time as changes are made.
    *   **Update**: I will add an "Edit" button to each workout in the list. This will open a modal or a new view with a form pre-filled with the workout's data, allowing for modifications.
    *   **Delete**: I will add a "Delete" button to each workout. A confirmation dialog will be implemented to prevent accidental deletions.
4.  **Data Persistence**: All CRUD operations will be integrated with the Supabase backend to ensure that all data is saved and persisted.
5.  **UI/UX**: The new UI elements for the CRUD operations will be designed to be consistent with the existing style of the application, ensuring a seamless user experience.
