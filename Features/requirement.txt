# New Requirement as Feature: 

hierarchical muscle group category list including sub-muscle groups with parent references, and a JavaScript list of workouts keyed by these detailed muscle groups with primary and secondary muscle IDs instead of names, merged across workout days.

Go back to the allWorkouts list we built and update all primary / secondary IDs to use these sub-muscle IDs instead of the old mixed list. That way, everything matches perfectly to this hierarchy.

    Example usage:
    "Upper Chest" (id: 7) has parent: 1 → parent is "Chest".
    "Front Deltoids" (id: 9) has parent: 2 → parent is "Shoulders".
    "Triceps" (id: 14) has parent: 3 → parent is "Arms".
This means:
    primary and secondary in your allWorkouts can point to sub-muscle IDs.
    You can easily get both the sub-muscle name and its parent group in one lookup.
