This feature aligns the background colors of the Settings and Logout pages with the Record Workout page for both light and dark themes, ensuring a consistent user experience.

### Plan & Execution

1. **Analyze `RecordWorkout.vue`:** Identify the background color classes used for light and dark themes.
2. **Update `SettingsView.vue`:** Apply the same background color classes to the main container.
3. **Update `LoginView.vue`:** Apply the same background color classes to the main container, which also handles the logout view.
4. **Verify Changes:** Manually test the application to confirm that the background colors are consistent across all three pages in both light and dark modes.
