# Feature: Style Settings Page

## Description

The user wants the settings page to have a consistent style with the rest of the application. This will be achieved by applying the same CSS classes used in other views, such as the Login view, to the Settings view.

## Plan & Execution

1.  **Analyze Existing Styles:** I have already examined the `LoginView.vue` file to identify the classes responsible for the page layout and styling.
2.  **Apply Styles to Settings View:** I will now apply these classes to the `SettingsView.vue` file.
3.  **Verify Consistency:** After applying the styles, I will confirm that the Settings page visually matches the other pages in the application.
