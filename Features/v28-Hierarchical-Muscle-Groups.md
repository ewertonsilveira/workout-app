# Feature: Hierarchical Muscle Groups and Workout Refactor

## Version: 28

### User Story

As a user, I want to see my workouts organized by specific muscle groups and sub-groups so that I can better understand the focus of each exercise and build more targeted workout plans.

### New Data Structure

A hierarchical muscle group category list including sub-muscle groups with parent references, and a JavaScript list of workouts keyed by these detailed muscle groups with primary and secondary muscle IDs instead of names, merged across workout days.

Go back to the allWorkouts list we built and update all primary / secondary IDs to use these sub-muscle IDs instead of the old mixed list. That way, everything matches perfectly to this hierarchy.

**Muscle Groups:**

```javascript
const muscleGroups = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Chest', parent: null },
  { id: 2, name: 'Shoulders', parent: null },
  { id: 3, name: 'Arms', parent: null },
  { id: 4, name: 'Back', parent: null },
  { id: 5, name: 'Core', parent: null },
  { id: 6, name: 'Legs', parent: null },

  { id: 7, name: 'Upper Chest', parent: 1 },
  { id: 8, name: 'Lower Chest', parent: 1 },

  { id: 9, name: 'Front Deltoids', parent: 2 },
  { id: 10, name: 'Side Deltoids', parent: 2 },
  { id: 11, name: 'Rear Deltoids', parent: 2 },
  { id: 12, name: 'Rotator Cuff', parent: 2 },
  { id: 13, name: 'Traps', parent: 2 },

  { id: 14, name: 'Triceps', parent: 3 },
  { id: 15, name: 'Biceps', parent: 3 },
  { id: 16, name: 'Forearms & Grip', parent: 3 },

  { id: 17, name: 'Lats', parent: 4 },
  { id: 18, name: 'Rhomboids', parent: 4 },
  { id: 19, name: 'Lower Back', parent: 4 },

  { id: 20, name: 'Abdominals', parent: 5 },
  { id: 21, name: 'Obliques', parent: 5 },

  { id: 22, name: 'Quads', parent: 6 },
  { id: 23, name: 'Hamstrings', parent: 6 },
  { id: 24, name: 'Glutes', parent: 6 },
  { id: 25, name: 'Calves', parent: 6 },
];
```

**Updated Workouts List:**

### Plan & Execution

1.  **Create Feature File:** Create this file (`v28-Hierarchical-Muscle-Groups.md`).
2.  **Refactor Data Structure (`useWorkoutStore.ts`):**
    - Replace the current `allWorkouts` array and `workoutTemplates` object with the new `muscleGroups` and `allWorkouts` list.
    - Update the `Exercise` interface to `primary: number`, `secondary: number[]`, `details: string`.
    - Remove the `generatePlan` and `resetDay` functions. The store will now provide the complete `muscleGroups` and `allWorkouts` lists.
3.  **Update UI Components:**
    - **`WorkoutPlanner.vue`:** Replace the day-based tabs with a filtering UI for muscle groups.
    - **`WorkoutDay.vue`:** Refactor to display workouts based on the selected muscle group filter.
    - **`ExerciseItem.vue`:** Update to display exercise details and look up muscle group names from IDs.
    - **`NumberStepper.vue`:** This component will be temporarily disconnected as the `sets`, `reps`, `weight` are now a single `details` string.
