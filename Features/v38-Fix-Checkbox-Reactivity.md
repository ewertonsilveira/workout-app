This feature addresses and resolves the issue where the checkbox in `ExerciseItem.vue` was not updating the completion status of exercises.

### Plan & Execution

1.  **Identify Reactivity Issue:** The problem stemmed from Vue's reactivity system not always detecting direct mutations of deeply nested properties within a reactive object.
2.  **Modify `toggleCompletion`:** Updated the `toggleCompletion` function in `src/composables/useWorkoutStore.ts`.
    *   Instead of directly toggling `exercise.completed`,
    *   A new exercise object is created using the spread operator (`...exercise`) to copy existing properties and then explicitly setting the `completed` property to its new value.
    *   The old exercise object in the `store.exercises[day][category]` array is then replaced with this new `updatedExercise` object.

This approach ensures that Vue's reactivity system properly detects the change, leading to the UI being updated correctly when the checkbox is clicked.
